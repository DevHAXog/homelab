# Cybersecurity Homelab on Proxmox

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity homelab repository! This setup is powered by Proxmox and consists of multiple VMs dedicated to OSINT, penetration testing, and cloud engineering. This environment is designed to simulate real-world scenarios for hands-on learning and research in various cybersecurity domains.

## üõ†Ô∏è Homelab Overview

My homelab is hosted on Proxmox, a powerful open-source virtualization platform. The lab consists of a series of virtual machines, each focused on a different cybersecurity domain:

- **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence):** Tools and platforms for gathering intelligence from publicly available sources.
- **Pentesting (Penetration Testing):** Virtual machines for running penetration testing tools, exploiting vulnerabilities, and assessing security.
- **Cloud Engineering:** A dedicated setup to simulate cloud environments for testing security configurations and conducting cloud penetration tests.

## üíª Architecture

The homelab consists of:

- **Virtualization Platform:** Proxmox (hosted on a dedicated physical machine or server)
- **Operating Systems:** Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Windows Server, and other OSes for different use cases
- **Tools & Platforms:** Metasploit, Burp Suite, Wireshark, OSQuery, Splunk, ELK Stack, AWS, and more
- **Networking:** Virtualized routers, switches, firewalls to simulate real-world network configurations

## üìö Setup Guide

1. **Proxmox Installation**
   - Install Proxmox on your physical server or host machine to manage the VMs.
   
2. **Create & Configure VMs**
   - Set up virtual machines for each specific use case (OSINT, Pentesting, Cloud Engineering).
   
3. **Network Configuration**
   - Configure virtualized network infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls) within Proxmox.

4. **Install & Configure Tools**
   - Install and configure cybersecurity tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, and others on the VMs.

5. **Cloud Environment Simulation**
   - Set up cloud platforms like AWS or simulate private cloud environments for penetration testing and security practice.
